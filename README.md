The inputs are a couple of specification files (application and hardware). The software tool consists of a parser, a set of mapping algorithms, a random graph generator, a performance evaluation and a configuration context generator.

## Specification Files

The inputs of the tool are a couple of specification file. Some examples of this are in the folder configfiles/

### Application specification file

An example of a specification file is showed in the following figure
